## User Input

How to assign variables with user input (to enter new information into the program).

While we output a variables value using print(), we assign information to a variable using `input()`. 

The **`input()` function requires a prompt message**, which it will print out for the user before they enter the new information. 

For example:

```py
likes_snakes = input("Do you like snakes? ")
```

In the example above, the following would occur:

- The program would print *"Do you like snakes? "* for the user.
- The user would enter an answer (e.g., "Yes! I have seven pythons as pets!") and press enter.
- The variable likes_snakes would be assigned a value of the users answer.

Try constructing a statement to collect user input on your own!
