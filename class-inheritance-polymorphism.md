# Learn Python: Inheritance and Polymorphism

## Inheritance

Classes are designed to allow for more code reuse, but what if we need a class that looks a lot like a class we already have? If the bulk of a class’s definition is useful, but we have a new use case that is distinct from how the original class was used, we can inherit from the original class.    
Think of inheritance as a remix — it sounds a lot like the original, but there’s something… different about it.

```py
class User:
  is_admin = False
  def __init__(self, username)
    self.username = username
 
class Admin(User):
  is_admin = True
```

Above we defined User as our base class. We want to create a new class that inherits from it, so we created the subclass Admin. In the above example, Admin has the same constructor as User. Only the class variable is_admin is set differently between the two.

Sometimes a base class is called a parent class. In these terms, the class inheriting from it, the subclass, is also referred to as a child class.

### Exercise Instructions

In script.py we’ve already defined the class Bin. Create a subclass of Bin called RecyclingBin.

### :flashlight: Hint:

Use this syntax to subclass an existing class:

```py
class Subclass(Superclass):
  pass
```

### Solution

```py
class Bin:
  pass

class RecyclingBin(Bin):
  pass
```



## Exceptions

There’s one very important family of class definitions built in to the Python language. **An Exception is a class that inherits from Python’s Exception class.**

We can validate this ourselves using the `issubclass()` function. `issubclass()` is a Python built-in function that takes two parameters. `issubclass()` returns True if the first argument is a subclass of the second argument. It returns False if the first class is not a subclass of the second. `issubclass()` raises a TypeError if either argument passed in is not a class.

```py
issubclass(ZeroDivisionError, Exception)
# Returns True
```

Above, we checked whether *ZeroDivisionError*, the exception raised when attempting division by zero, is a subclass of Exception. It is, so issubclass returns True.

Why is it beneficial for exceptions to inherit from one another?    
Let’s consider an example where we create our own exceptions. What if we were creating software that tracks our kitchen appliances? We would be able to design a suite of exceptions for that need:

```py
class KitchenException(Exception):
  """
  Exception that gets thrown when a kitchen appliance isn't working
  """
 
class MicrowaveException(KitchenException):
  """
  Exception for when the microwave stops working
  """
 
class RefrigeratorException(KitchenException):
  """
  Exception for when the refrigerator stops working
  """
```

In this code, we define three exceptions.     
First, we define a *KitchenException* that acts as the parent to our other, specific kitchen appliance exceptions. *KitchenException* subclasses Exception, so it behaves in the same way that regular Exceptions do.     
Afterward we define MicrowaveException and *RefrigeratorException* as subclasses.

Since our exceptions are subclassed in this way, we can catch any of *KitchenException*‘s subclasses by catching *KitchenException*. 

For example:

```py
def get_food_from_fridge():
  if refrigerator.cooling == False:
    raise RefrigeratorException
  else:
    return food
 
def heat_food(food):
  if microwave.working == False:
    raise MicrowaveException
  else:
    microwave.cook(food)
    return food
 
try:
  food = get_food_from_fridge()
  food = heat_food(food)
except KitchenException:
  food = order_takeout()
```

In the above example, we attempt to retrieve food from the fridge and heat it in the microwave. If either *RefrigeratorException* or *MicrowaveException* is raised, we opt to order takeout instead. We catch both *RefrigeratorException* and *MicrowaveException* in our try/except block because both are subclasses of *KitchenException*.

Explore Python’s exception hierarchy in the Python documentation!

https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#exception-hierarchy


### Exercise Instructions

1.

In script.py we’ve defined a CandleShop class for our new candle shop that we’ve named Here’s a Hot Tip: Buy Drip Candles. We want to define our own exceptions for when we run out of candles to sell.

Define your own exception called OutOfStock that inherits from the Exception class.

2.

Have CandleShop raise your OutOfStock exception when CandleShop.buy() tries to buy a candle that’s out of stock.

### :flashlight: Hint: 

Remember subclassing a class involves using parentheses syntax

```py
class Subclass(Superclass):
  pass
```

Use the Python built-in Exception as your superclass and you’ll define an exception!	
We reject code that raise exceptions, so don’t raise OutOfStock explicitly outside of the .buy() method in the CandleShop class.

<br>

### Solution 

```py
# Define your exception up here:
class OutOfStock(Exception):
  pass

# Update the class below to raise OutOfStock
class CandleShop:
  name = "Here's a Hot Tip: Buy Drip Candles"
  def __init__(self, stock):
    self.stock = stock
    
  def buy(self, color):
    if self.stock[color] < 1:
      raise OutOfStock
    self.stock[color] = self.stock[color] - 1

candle_shop = CandleShop({'blue': 6, 'red': 2, 'green': 0})
candle_shop.buy('blue')

# This should raise OutOfStock:
# candle_shop.buy('green')
```

<br>

## Overriding Methods

Inheritance is a useful way of creating objects with different class variables, but is that all it’s good for? What if one of the methods needs to be implemented differently? In Python, all we have to do to override a method definition is to offer a new definition for the method in our subclass.

An overridden method is one that has a different definition from its parent class. What if *User* class didn’t have an *is_admin* flag but just checked if it had permission for something based on a permissions dictionary? 

It could look like this:

```py
class User:
  def __init__(self, username, permissions):
    self.username = username
    self.permissions = permissions
 
  def has_permission_for(self, key):
    if self.permissions.get(key):
      return True
    else:
      return False
```

Above we defined a class *User* which takes a permissions parameter in its constructor. Let’s assume permissions is a dict. *User* has a method `.has_permission_for()` implemented, where it checks to see if a given key is in its permissions dictionary.

We could then define our Admin user like this:

```py
class Admin(User):
  def has_permission_for(self, key):
    return True
```

Here we define an *Admin* class that subclasses *User*. It has all methods, attributes, and functionality that *User* has. However, if you call has_permission_for on an instance of *Admin*, it won’t check its permissions dictionary. Since this *User* is also an *Admin*, we just say they have permission to see everything!

### Exercise Instructions

1.

In script.py, we’ve defined two classes, Message and User. Create an Admin class that subclasses the User class.

2.

Override User‘s .edit_message() method in Admin so that an Admin can edit any messages.

```py
class Message:
  def __init__(self, sender, recipient, text):
    self.sender = sender
    self.recipient = recipient
    self.text = text

class User:
  def __init__(self, username):
    self.username = username
    
  def edit_message(self, message, new_text):
    if message.sender == self.username:
      message.text = new_text
      
class Admin(User):
  def edit_message(self, message, new_text):
    message.text = new_text

```


## Super()

Overriding methods is really useful in some cases but sometimes we want to add some extra logic to the existing method. In order to do that we need a way to call the method from the parent class. Python gives us a way to do that using **`super()`**.

**`super()` gives us a proxy object.** With this proxy object, we can invoke the method of an object’s parent class (also called its superclass).   
We call the required function as a method on `super()`:

```py
class Sink:
  def __init__(self, basin, nozzle):
    self.basin = basin
    self.nozzle = nozzle
 
class KitchenSink(Sink):
  def __init__(self, basin, nozzle, trash_compactor=None):
    super().__init__(basin, nozzle)
    if trash_compactor:
      self.trash_compactor = trash_compactor
```

Above we defined two classes. First, we defined a *Sink* class with a constructor that assigns a rinse *basin* and a sink *nozzle* to a Sink instance. Afterwards, we defined a *KitchenSink* class that inherits from *Sink*. *KitchenSink*‘s constructor takes an additional parameter, a trash_compactor. *KitchenSink* then calls the constructor for *Sink* with the *basin* and *nozzle* it received using the super() function, with this line of code:

```py
super().__init__(basin, nozzle)
```

This line says: “call the constructor (the function called `__init__()`) of the class that is this class’s parent class.” In the example given, *KitchenSink‘s* constructor calls the constructor for *Sink*. In this way, we can override a parent class’s method to add some new functionality (like adding a trash_compactor to a sink), while still retaining the behavior of the original constructor (like setting the basin and nozzle as instance variables).

### Exercise Instructions

1.

You’re invited to a potluck this week and decide to make your own special version of Potato Salad!

In script.py you’ll find a class called PotatoSalad, make a subclass of PotatoSalad called SpecialPotatoSalad.

2.

Your special potato salad recipe is pretty similar to a regular potato salad, so let’s start with making that.

Create a new constructor for SpecialPotatoSalad that just calls the parent constructor for PotatoSalad. Make sure that SpecialPotatoSalad‘s constructor takes the same arguments as PotatoSalad.

3.

The difference with your special potato salad is… you add raisins to it! You can’t remember when you started doing this, but Dolores always hoots about it at her potlucks and if that isn’t the nicest thing. You always use the full package of raisins for every potato salad you make, and each package has 40 raisins in it.

In your constructor for SpecialPotatoSalad, after making regular potato salad, set

```py
self.raisins = 40.
```

### :flashlight: Hint:
Create an `__init__()` method for *SpecialPotatoSalad* with the same arguments as *PotatoSalad*.

In the `__init__()` method, call the parent class’s method with this syntax:

```py
class SubClass(ParentClass):
  def inherited_method(self, arg1, arg2):
    super().inherited_method(arg1, arg2)
```

<br>

### Solution

```py
class PotatoSalad:
  def __init__(self, potatoes, celery, onions):
    self.potatoes = potatoes
    self.celery = celery
    self.onions = onions
    
class SpecialPotatoSalad(PotatoSalad):
  def __init__(self, potatoes, celery, onions):
    super().__init__(potatoes, celery, onions)
    self.raisins = 40

```

<br>

## Interfaces

You may be wondering at this point why we would even want to have two different classes with two differently implemented methods to use the same method name.     
This style is especially useful when we have an object for which it might not matter which class the object is an instance of. Instead, we’re interested in whether that object can perform a given task.

If we have the following code:

```py
class Chess:
  def __init__(self):
    self.board = setup_board()
    self.pieces = add_chess_pieces()
 
  def play(self):
    print("Playing chess!")
 
class Checkers:
  def __init__(self):
    self.board = setup_board()
    self.pieces = add_checkers_pieces()
 
  def play(self):
    print("Playing checkers!")
```

In the code above we define two classes, Chess and Checkers. In Chess we define a constructor that sets up the board and pieces, and a .play() method. Checkers also defines a .play() method. If we have a play_game() function that takes an instance of Chess or Checkers, it could call the .play() method without having to check which class the object is an instance of.

```py
def play_game(chess_or_checkers):
  chess_or_checkers.play()
 
chess_game = Chess()
checkers_game = Checkers()
chess_game_2 = Chess()
 
for game in [chess_game, checkers_game, chess_game_2]:
  play_game(game)
"""
Prints out the following:
Playing chess!
Playing checkers!
Playing chess!
```

In this code, we defined a play_game function that could take either a Chess object or a Checkers object. We instantiate a few objects and then call play_game on each.

When two classes have the same method names and attributes, we say they implement the same interface. An interface in Python usually refers to the names of the methods and the arguments they take. Other programming languages have more rigid definitions of what an interface is, but it usually hinges on the fact that different objects from different classes can perform the same operation (even if it is implemented differently for each class).

### Exercise Instructions

1.

In script.py we’ve defined an InsurancePolicy class. Create a subclass of InsurancePolicy called VehicleInsurance.

2.

Create a different subclass of InsurancePolicy called HomeInsurance.

3.

Give VehicleInsurance a .get_rate() method that takes self as a parameter. Return .001 multiplied by the price of the vehicle.

4.

Give HomeInsurance a .get_rate() method that takes self as a parameter. Return .00005 multiplied by the price of the home.

```py
class InsurancePolicy:
  def __init__(self, price_of_item):
    self.price_of_insured_item = price_of_item
    
class VehicleInsurance(InsurancePolicy):
  def get_rate(self):
    return self.price_of_insured_item * .001

class HomeInsurance(InsurancePolicy):
  def get_rate(self):
    return self.price_of_insured_item * .00005

```

<br>

---

## Polymorphism

All this talk of interfaces demonstrates flexibility in programming. Flexibility in programming is a broad philosophy, but what’s worth remembering is that we want to implement forms that are familiar in our programs so that usage is expected. For example, let’s think of the **`+` operator**. It’s easy to think of it as a single function that “adds” whatever is on the left with whatever is on the right, but it does many different things in different contexts:

```py
# For an int and an int, + returns an int
2 + 4 == 6
 
# For a float and a float, + returns a float
3.1 + 2.1 == 5.2
 
# For a string and a string, + returns a string
"Is this " + "addition?" == "Is this addition?"
 
# For a list and a list, + returns a list
[1, 2] + [3, 4] == [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

Look at all the different things that + does! The hope is that all of these things are, for the arguments given to them, the intuitive result of adding them together. Polymorphism is the term used to describe the same syntax (like the + operator here, but it could be a method name) doing different actions depending on the type of data.

Polymorphism is an abstract concept that covers a lot of ground, but defining class hierarchies that all implement the same interface is a way of introducing polymorphism to our code.

### Exercise Instructions

1.

In script.py a few different types of data are provided. Call len() on each of them.

Is the same operation happening for each? How is it different? How is it similar? Does using len() to refer to these different operations make sense?

```py
a_list = [1, 18, 32, 12]
a_dict = {'value': True}
a_string = "Polymorphism is cool!"

len(a_list)
len(a_dict)
len(a_string)
```

---

## Dunder Methods

One way that we can introduce polymorphism to our class definitions is by using Python’s special dunder methods. We’ve explored a few already, the constructor `__init__()` and the string representation method `__repr__`, but that’s only scratching the tip of the iceberg.

Python gives us the power to define dunder methods that define a custom-made class to look and behave like a Python builtin. What does that mean?     
Say we had a class that has an addition method:

```py
class Color:
  def __init__(self, red, green, blue):
    self.red = red
    self.green = green
    self.blue = blue
 
 
  def __repr__(self):
    return "Color with RGB = ({red}, {green}, {blue})".format(red=self.red, green=self.green, blue=self.blue)
 
  def add(self, other):
    """
    Adds two RGB colors together
    Maximum value is 255
    """
    new_red = min(self.red + other.red, 255)
    new_green = min(self.green + other.green, 255)
    new_blue = min(self.blue + other.blue, 255)
 
    return Color(new_red, new_green, new_blue)
 
red = Color(255, 0, 0)
blue = Color(0, 0, 255)
 
magenta = red.add(blue)
print(magenta)
# Prints "Color with RGB = (255, 0, 255)"
```

In this code we defined a Color class that implements an addition function. Unfortunately, red.add(blue) is a little verbose for something that we have an intuitive symbol for (i.e., the + symbol). Well, Python offers the dunder method `__add__` for this very reason!   
If we rename the add() method above to something that looks like this:

```py
class Color: 
  def __add__(self, other):
    """
    Adds two RGB colors together
    Maximum value is 255
    """
    new_red = min(self.red + other.red, 255)
    new_green = min(self.green + other.green, 255)
    new_blue = min(self.blue + other.blue, 255)
 
    return Color(new_red, new_green, new_blue)
```

Then, if we create the colors:

```py
red = Color(255, 0, 0)
green = Color(0, 255, 0)
blue = Color(0, 0, 255)
``` 

We can add them together using the + operator!

```py
# Color with RGB: (255, 0, 255)
magenta = red + blue
 
# Color with RGB: (0, 255, 255)
cyan = green + blue
 
# Color with RGB: (255, 255, 0)
yellow = red + green
 
# Color with RGB: (255, 255, 255)
white = red + green + blue
```

Since we defined an **`__add__`** method for our Color class, we were able to add these objects together using the **+ operator**.

### Exercise Instructions

1.

In script.py there are two classes defined, Atom and Molecule.

Give Atom a .__add__(self, other) method that returns a Molecule with the two Atoms together in a list.

### :flashlight: Hint

This should `return Molecule([self, other])`

<br>

### Solution

```py
class Atom:
  def __init__(self, label):
    self.label = label
    
  def __add__(self, other):
    return Molecule([self, other])
    
class Molecule:
  def __init__(self, atoms):
    if type(atoms) is list:
	    self.atoms = atoms
      
sodium = Atom("Na")
chlorine = Atom("Cl")
salt = Molecule([sodium, chlorine])
# salt = sodium + chlorine
```


## Dunder Methods II

Python offers a whole suite of magic methods a class can implement that will allow us to use the same syntax as Python’s built-in data types.     
You can write functionality that allows custom defined types to behave like lists:

https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typeiter

```py
class UserGroup:
  def __init__(self, users, permissions):
    self.user_list = users
    self.permissions = permissions
 
  def __iter__(self):
    return iter(self.user_list)
 
  def __len__(self):
    return len(self.user_list)
 
  def __contains__(self, user):
    return user in self.user_list
```

In our UserGroup class above we defined three methods:

    __init__(), our constructor, which sets a list of users to the instance variable self.user_list and sets the group’s permissions when we create a new UserGroup.

    __iter__, the iterator, we use the iter() function to turn the list self.user_list into an iterator so we can use for user in user_group syntax. For more information on iterators, review Python’s documentation of Iterator Types.

    __len__, the length method, so when we call len(user_group) it will return the length of the underlying self.user_list list.

    __contains__, the check for containment, allows us to use user in user_group syntax to check if a User exists in the user_list we have.

These methods allow UserGroup to act like a list using syntax Python programmers will already be familiar with. If all you need is something to act like a list you could absolutely have used a list, but if you want to bundle some other information (like a group’s permissions, for instance) having syntax that allows for list-like operations can be very powerful.

We would be able to use the following code to do this, for example:

```py
class User:
  def __init__(self, username):
    self.username = username
 
diana = User('diana')
frank = User('frank')
jenn = User('jenn')
 
can_edit = UserGroup([diana, frank], {'can_edit_page': True})
can_delete = UserGroup([diana, jenn], {'can_delete_posts': True})
 
print(len(can_edit))
# Prints 2
 
for user in can_edit:
  print(user.username)
# Prints "diana" and "frank"
 
if frank in can_delete:
  print("Since when do we allow Frank to delete things? Does no one remember when he accidentally deleted the site?")
```

Above we created a set of users and then added them to UserGroups with specific permissions. Then we used Python built-in functions and syntax to calculate the length of a UserGroup, to iterate through a UserGroup and to check for a User‘s membership in a UserGroup.

### Exercise Instructions

1.

In script.py you’ll find the class LawFirm. Give LawFirm a `.__len__()` method that will return the number of lawyers in the law firm.

2.

Give LawFirm a `.__contains__()` method that takes two parameters: self and lawyer and checks to see if lawyer is in self.lawyers.

```py
class LawFirm:
  def __init__(self, practice, lawyers):
    self.practice = practice
    self.lawyers = lawyers
    
  def __len__(self):
    return len(self.lawyers)
  
  def __contains__(self, lawyer):
    return lawyer in self.lawyers
    
d_and_p = LawFirm("Injury", ["Donelli", "Paderewski"])
```

## Review

In this lesson, we learned more complicated relationships between classes. We learned:

- How to create a subclass of an existing class.
- How to redefine existing methods of a parent class in a subclass by overriding them.
- How to leverage a parent class’s methods in the body of a subclass method using the super() function.
- How to define a Python exception that inherits from Exception.
- How to write programs that are flexible using interfaces and polymorphism.
- How to write data types that look and feel like native data types with dunder methods.

These are really complicated concepts! It’s a long journey to get to the state of comfortably being able to build class hierarchies that embody the concerns that your software will need to. Give yourself a pat on the back, you earned it!

### Exercise Instructions

1.

Create a class SortedList that inherits from the built-in type list.

2.

Recall that lists have a .append() method that takes a two arguments, self and value. We’re going to have SortedList perform a sort after every .append().

Overwrite the append method, leave it blank for now with the pass keyword.

3.

First, we want our new .append() to actually add the item to the list.		
Write the code that would get SortedList to behave like a normal list when calling the .append() method.

4.

After you’ve appended the new value, sort the list.

5.

Incredible! We subclassed a Python primitive and introduced new behavior to it.

Some things to consider:

- When a SortedList gets initialized with unsorted values (say if you call SortedList([4, 1, 5])) those values don’t get sorted!      
How would you change SortedList so that the list is sorted right after the object gets created?

- What other Python builtins have functionality “missing”?    
Could you write a new dictionary that uses a fallback value when it tries to retrieve an item and can’t?


### :flashlight: Hint

You can call a parent class method using the super() function like this:

```py
def class_method(self, argument1):
  super().class_method(argument1)
```

You can use the self keyword to refer to the list in question here, so just call self.sort().


### Solution

```py
class SortedList(list):
  def append(self, value):
    super().append(value)
    self.sort()
```
